* You may wonder what the relationship between this and Amper
* Amper is an experiment with similar goals that we are also learning from to inform our development. 
* Our approach is to greatly simplify build configuration with a focus on Software Developers and improved toolability without sacrificing any of Gradle's flexibility or scalability.
* We're confident we can deliver on this vision and that you won't even need Amper.
