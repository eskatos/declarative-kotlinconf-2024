Gradle can look declarative

[%step]
* Keep build logic in plugins
* Give your convention plugins meaningful names
* Keep your build scripts simple - condition and loop free

`build.gradle.kts`
```kotlin
plugins {
    id("backend-library-conventions")
}

dependencies {
    api(libs.commons.math3)
    implementation(libs.guava)
}
```

But this might not be enough.

[.notes]
--
* We know what kind of thing we're building (a backend library)
* We only have to deal with our direct dependencies
