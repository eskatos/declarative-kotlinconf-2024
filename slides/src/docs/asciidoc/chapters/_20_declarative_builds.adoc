=== Overcoming challenges [.small]#- Definitions#

image::gradle/bg-11.png[background,size=cover]

* Software Definition
** _What_ needs to be built
** Kind of software, languages, target platforms
** Dependencies, toolchains, quality checks etc...
* Build Logic
** _How_ the software will be built
** Adds new capabilities, integrate tools
** Supplies convention to the software definition

=== Overcoming challenges [.small]#- Recommendations#
image::gradle/bg-7.png[background, size=cover]

Gradle can look declarative

* Keep build logic in plugins
* Give your convention plugins meaningful names
* Keep your build scripts simple - condition and loop free

=== Overcoming challenges [.small]#- &#x1F389;#

`build.gradle.kts`
```kotlin
plugins {
    id("backend-library-conventions")
}

dependencies {
    api(libs.commons.math3)
    implementation(libs.guava)
}
```

But this might not be enough.

[.notes]
--
* We know what kind of thing we're building (a backend library)
* We only have to deal with our direct dependencies
