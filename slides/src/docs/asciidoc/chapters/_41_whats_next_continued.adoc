* Multiple conventions for the same software type
* Restricted configurability for a software type
* Entirely new software types/ecosystems

=== What's next? [.small]#- Multiple Software type conventions#

For example, a build with two different KMP libraries.

`settings.gradle.dcl`
```kotlin
softwareTypes {
    legacyLibrary {
        ...
    }
    nextGenerationLibrary {
        compose {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

=== What's next? [.small]#- Software type conventions#
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

Some reusable conventions cross software type boundaries.

For example, Compose can be used by KMP or Android.

`settings.gradle.dcl`
```kotlin
conventions {
    compose {
        kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion = "1.5.12"
    }
}
softwareTypes {
    kmpLibrary {
        compose = conventions.compose
    }
    androidLibrary {
        compose = conventions.compose
    }
}
```
