Some reusable conventions cross software type boundaries.

For example, Compose can be used by KMP or Android.

`settings.gradle.dcl`
```kotlin
conventions {
    compose {
        kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion = "1.5.12"
    }
}
softwareTypes {
    kmpLibrary {
        compose = conventions.compose
    }
    androidLibrary {
        compose = conventions.compose
    }
}
```
