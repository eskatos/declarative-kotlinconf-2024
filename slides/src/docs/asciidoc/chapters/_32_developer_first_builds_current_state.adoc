=== Developer-first builds [.small]#- Teams#

image::gradle/bg-11.png[background,size=cover]

We work on this together ü§ù

* Multiple teams at Gradle (DSL, Software, IDE)
* Android Studio team at Google
* IntelliJ, Kotlin & Amper teams at JetBrains

=== Developer-first builds [.small]#- Disclaimers#

image::gradle/bg-11.png[background,size=cover]

* These are experiments.
* Prototypes require a Gradle nightly.
* IDE features require an Android Studio nightly.
* Prototypes are changing all the time and are not ready for production use.

=== Developer-first builds [.small]#- Declarative Configuration Language#

image::gradle/bg-11.png[background,size=cover]

* Purely declarative
* Small subset of the Kotlin language
* Fast and resilient parser
* Schemas & Documents

=== Developer-first builds [.small]#- Tooling#

image::gradle/bg-11.png[background,size=cover]

* Get projects schemas via Gradle's Tooling API
** After build settings are evaluated
** Before configuring any project
* Load documents for project definitions
** Validate using the schema
** DOM-like API
* This is data!
** JSON Serialization

=== Developer-first builds [.small]#- Performance#

[.notes]

This is to be taken with a grain of salt because while we will make things slower by adding features and correctness, we have not optimized yet, and we know we can make things faster.
This gives us a baseline and will help manage the Declarative DSL performance characteristics as we evolve the implementation.
