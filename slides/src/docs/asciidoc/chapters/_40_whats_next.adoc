A peak into the future

=== What's next? [.small]#- Mutations#
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

Mutations are Gradle guided changes available from tooling and command-line.

Provided out of the box by Gradle or registered by plugins.

Examples:

* Update Gradle from 9.0 -> 9.1
* Add Compose to this project
* Upgrade an external dependency
* Refactor this project to use non-deprecated properties

=== What's next? [.small]#- Sync resilience#
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

Progressively provide more context instead of a monolithic sync step.

Avoid slow recompilation of build scripts when build logic changes.

   * Reparsing declarative files is fast.

Errors in a declarative file don't need to be fatal to sync.

   * Best effort: know what "kind" of project it is at least.
