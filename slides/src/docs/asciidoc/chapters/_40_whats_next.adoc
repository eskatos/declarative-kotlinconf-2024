* Integrated with IDE workflow (preview/diff, undo)
* Provided out of the box by Gradle or registered by plugins

=== What's next? [.small]#- Mutations / Refactorings#

Examples

* Upgrade an external dependency
* Add Compose to this project
* Update Gradle from 9.0 -> 9.1
* Refactor this project to use non-deprecated properties

=== What's next? [.small]#- Quick and resilient IDE sync#

image::gradle/bg-4.png[background,size=cover]

[%step]
* Progressively provide more context +
  instead of a monolithic sync step.
* Avoid slow recompilation of build scripts when build logic changes. +
  Reparsing declarative files is fast.
* Errors in a declarative file don't need to be fatal to sync +
  Best effort: know what "kind" of project it is at least.


=== What's next? [.small]#- Other IDEs#
image::gradle/bg-4.png[background, size=cover]

* We want all features to be available to most IDEs
* We're working with JetBrains and Google for their IDEs
* Our IDE team is exploring
** LSP language server & BSP build server
** plugins for both Eclipse/Buildship and Visual Studio Code
* LSP & BSP should allow to add support in many other IDEs
